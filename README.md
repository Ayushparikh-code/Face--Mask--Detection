## :star: Features
The Face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it‚Äôs also¬†computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
This dataset consists of¬†__3833 images__¬†belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1915 images__
*	__without_mask: 1918 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks and not wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
* __Bing & Google Search API__  
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__  
* __Open-Source Stock Image Websites__
